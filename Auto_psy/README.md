### Verifying the Hash  value of the file with Hash Calc ###

**F 201.1: SHA1 (5 pts)**

Verify that the MD5 value matches the value shown below. If it does not, re-download the evidence file.

So here we can see the MD5 Hash values other values that are provided by the hash calc software.


After that we wil unzip the case file and load it into autopsy

**F 201.2: Mother and Child (5 pts)**

Find the image of a mother rhinoceros and her child. That's the flag.

So we found the mother and child and the file name is `f0105864.jpg`.

**F 201.3: Hard Drive (5 pts)**

Find the location of the missing hard drive. That's the flag.

 I zapped the hard drive and then threw it into the Mississippi River.


**F 201.4: Email Address (10 pts extra)**

There are two files containing an email address at MIT. Only one of the files has a real filename. (A filename beginning with "Unalloc" is a fake filename generated by Autopsy for files recovered from unallocated clusters.)
Here we use substring based keyword find the email.

And we found it and the emial is `philg@mit.edu`.
